# Cline Project Collaboration Rules

Cline has access to Git and GitHub tools to help automate and enforce these collaboration rules.

## Commit Workflow

- Commit each major step as you go, before proceeding to the next step.

## Issue-Driven Development Workflow

1. **All Major Tasks Require Issues**
   - Every significant feature, bug fix, or change must have a corresponding GitHub issue.
   - Issues should be descriptive, outlining the problem, goal, or feature clearly.

2. **Work via Pull Requests**
   - All code changes must be made in branches and submitted as pull requests (PRs).
   - Each PR must reference the relevant issue(s) it addresses (e.g., "Closes #issue-number").
   - PR titles and descriptions should clearly state the purpose and link to the issue.

3. **Blockers, Challenges, and Status Updates**
   - Any blockers, questions, or status updates must be posted as comments on the relevant issue.
   - Use comments to discuss implementation details, request clarification, or provide progress updates.

4. **Review and Merge Process**
   - PRs should be reviewed before merging.
   - Only merge PRs after ensuring they address the issue and pass all checks.

5. **General Guidelines**
   - Keep communication clear and concise.
   - Reference issues and PRs in all discussions for traceability.
   - Update or close issues as work progresses and is completed.
